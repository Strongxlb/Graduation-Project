"""Step 5d: STRUCTURED within-zone heterogeneity — does the fit move off the arithmetic mean?

Location-consistent design (addresses the critique of the length-based five-group truth):
the truth keeps the three LOCATION zones, but WITHIN each zone the wall coefficient is
correlated with pipe length: longer pipes decay more strongly. The per-zone ARITHMETIC mean is
held exactly at the zone mean, while the LENGTH-weighted mean is shifted stronger, so the two
candidate "targets" of a three-zone homogeneous fit are separated and can be told apart.

Length weighting is only ONE candidate effective weighting, and it is NOT the hydraulically
effective one. The reaction weight of a pipe also depends on its flow, direction, diameter,
residence time and on how strongly the monitors see it, so "length-weighted" must never be read as
"residence-weighted" or as "the" effective mean — they are different quantities that happen to be
separated from the arithmetic mean in the same direction here. What this step establishes is a
DIRECTION of travel, not a target that is recovered: the fitted coefficient moves off the arithmetic
mean toward the length-weighted value without landing on it. Identifying the genuinely effective
weighting needs a sensitivity/Jacobian-weighted mean, which this step does not compute, so the
claim available from it is bounded accordingly.

PRIMARY: formal censored likelihood. COMPARATOR: informal GLUE at the primary threshold. This
matters for the size of the effect as well as its direction: on the homogeneous baseline the
informal score's weighted mean already sits away from the truth, so part of any shift it reports is
its own artefact, and the baseline offset of each scheme is recorded here for exactly that reason.

Contrast with Step 5a/5c (random, uncorrelated jitter): there length-weighted ~ arithmetic, so the
two targets coincide and no separation is observable. Here the correlation is what separates them.

Reuses the frozen baseline candidate predictions (truth-independent).
