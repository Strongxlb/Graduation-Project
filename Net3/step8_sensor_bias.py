"""Step 8: systematic sensor-bias experiment (empirical) — Priority-2 #1.

A constant offset (systematic bias) is added to ONE informative monitor (node 15, old zone) and the
calibration is re-run under the PRIMARY formal censored likelihood. Reported: how far the posterior
mean of the old coefficient is pushed relative to its own posterior SD, how that displacement scales
with the offset, and what happens to the operational risk ranking — which is the quantity a utility
would act on.

Scaling convention: shift(0.025)/shift(0.05) below 50% means SUPER-LINEAR (convex) growth, above 50%
sub-linear (concave).

The sweep is TWO-SIDED. Because observations are censored at the sensor floor, a negative offset is
not the mirror image of a positive one — it pushes readings onto the floor, where they carry
different information (see Step 9) — so the asymmetry is measured rather than assumed away.

Step 8c repeats the experiment at every monitor in turn; the worst case is not node 15.

Reuses the baseline cache (candidate predictions are observation-independent); the bias only changes
the observations, so no EPANET is re-run. 30 noise realisations.
