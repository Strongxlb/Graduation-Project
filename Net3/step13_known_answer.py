"""Step 13: known-answer test — are the coefficients realised as we set them? (Priority-2 #7)

Every result in this project assumes that a coefficient written as m/day or 1/day, divided by 86400
and handed to WNTR, arrives in EPANET as that coefficient. Nothing tested the assumption directly,
and the review already found one unit error in the reported figures, so the assumption is not
self-evidently safe.

The test is a single pipe with an analytic solution. Water leaves a reservoir at C0, travels a
distance L at velocity v, and decays. For first-order BULK decay with no wall reaction the
concentration at the far end once the front has passed is

**Formula**:

```
C(x) = C0 · exp(k_b · x / v) = C0 · exp(k_b · t_res),    t_res = x / v
```

with k_b < 0 in 1/s and t_res the residence time. Wall decay is checked separately: for a first-order
wall reaction EPANET uses an overall rate constant that combines the wall coefficient k_w (length per
time) with the mass-transfer coefficient k_f through

```
k_overall = k_b + (4 / D) · (k_w · k_f) / (k_w + k_f)
```

so a pure wall test cannot be predicted from k_w alone without k_f. The wall arm therefore checks the
weaker but still decisive property that the realised decay is MONOTONE in k_w and brackets the
k_f-limited and k_w-limited extremes, rather than asserting an exact analytic value.
