"""Step 8d: sensor DRIFT — a time-varying offset — Priority-2 #1, second half.

Step 8 and Step 8c model a *constant* sensor bias. The review's comment is headed "systematic sensor
error (bias, drift)", and a drifting sensor is the more common failure in practice: a probe fouls or
its calibration ages, so the offset grows over the record instead of sitting still. This step closes
that half.

DESIGN. Drift is a linear ramp across the 48 h assessment window:

    b(t) = D * (t - t0) / 48,    t in [120, 168] h

so the sensor reads correctly at the start of the window and is off by D at the end; its MEAN offset
over the window is D/2. Nothing is added before the window, which is irrelevant anyway because only
the post-warm-up slice enters the likelihood.

THE QUESTION THIS ANSWERS. A drift has a mean and a shape. If a drift did the same damage as a
constant bias of the same mean, then modelling constant bias alone would be sufficient and Step 8
would already cover this comment. So every drift arm is run against TWO constant-bias controls on
identical noise:

    const(D/2)   the MEAN-equivalent constant bias  — does the shape add anything?
    const(D)     the END-equivalent constant bias   — does the drift reach the same damage?

If drift(0->D) lands on const(D/2) the answer is "a drift is its own average" and constant-bias
results transfer; if it lands nearer const(D) the time structure matters on its own.

Two-sided, because observations are censored at the sensor floor and a negative offset is therefore
not the mirror image of a positive one (same reason as Step 8).

Two locations, both taken from what the earlier steps established: node 15 (old zone) is the Step 8
headline and the physically dominant coefficient; node 231 (average zone) is where Step 8c found the
largest NORMALISED corruption (-5.94 posterior SD at -0.10).

Weighting is the primary formal censored likelihood: Steps 3, 5c, 8 and 8b all show the informal
score is too flat to register a systematic error, so measuring drift with it would understate it.

Reuses the baseline cache — the candidate predictions do not depend on the observations, so no
EPANET is re-run. 30 noise realisations, medians reported.
